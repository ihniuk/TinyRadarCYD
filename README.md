# 📡 Micro Radar (ESP32 CYD Edition)

A tiny, premium, open-source flight radar for your desk. This version has been customized and upgraded from the [original round ESP32 micro-radar](https://github.com/AnthonySturdy/micro-radar) to run on the **ESP32 Cheap Yellow Display (CYD)**—a 3.2" 320x240 landscape color screen with interactive capacitive touch controls.

## ✨ Features (CYD Edition Upgrades)

* **Interactive Capacitive Touch Controls**:
  - **Focus Flight**: Tap on any tracked aircraft to select it.
  - **Live Dashboard**: Selecting an aircraft shows its Callign, Altitude, Speed, Distance from home, Heading, and flight path.
  - **Interactive Zoom**: Tap the radar grid to zoom in or zoom out dynamically.
  - **Clear Selection**: Tap the screen background to deselect the current aircraft.
* **Airport Route Lookup**:
  - Automatically queries the OpenSky Network Route API on-demand when an aircraft is focused.
  - Renders takeoff and landing airport codes directly on the dashboard (e.g. `EGKK->EGAA`).
* **Custom Map Paths (Vector Boundaries)**:
  - Supports entering coordinate lists to draw detailed coastlines, national borders, or restricted airspace in bright green vector lines.
* **Altitude Unit Toggle**:
  - Switch between **Meters (m)** and **Feet (ft)** directly via the settings page.
* **Dual-Core Safety & Stability**:
  - Built-in configuration cache prevents continuous NVS flash wear and watchdog resets.
  - Smart port-release logic resolves port 80 conflicts between WiFiManager and the settings server.

## 🚀 Getting Started

You can flash the firmware directly from your web browser without installing any tools or IDEs:

1. Open **[https://flash.ihni.uk](https://flash.ihni.uk)** in Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.
2. Connect your ESP32 CYD module to your computer via a USB-C data cable.
3. Click **Connect**, select your board's COM port, and click **Install**.
4. Once completed, press the physical **RESET** button on the back of the device to start.

## 🔧 First-Time Setup & WiFi Configuration

1. On first boot (or after erasing flash), the device creates a Wi-Fi hotspot named **`MicroRadar-Setup`**.
2. Connect to this hotspot from your phone or laptop.
3. A setup page will display automatically (or navigate to `http://192.168.4.1` in your browser).
4. Select your home network, enter your WiFi password, and click **Save**.
5. The device will save credentials and automatically perform a **clean reboot** to connect.

## ⚙️ Settings Configuration

Once connected to your home network, open any browser on the same network and navigate to:
👉 **[http://microradar.local](http://microradar.local)** (or the IP address shown on the screen setup log, e.g., `http://10.10.0.38`)

Here you can customize:
* **Latitude & Longitude**: The center point coordinates of your desk radar.
* **Radar Radius**: Scan diameter in degrees (max `2.5` degrees to comply with rate limiting).
* **OpenSky API Credentials**: Your client ID and secret (highly recommended to avoid strict rate-limiting bounds).
* **Altitude Unit**: Toggle between **Meters (m)** and **Feet (ft)**.
* **Display Toggles**: Enable/disable visual sweeps, directional headings, or aircraft labels.
* **Map Paths**: Paste JSON coordinate sequences to draw custom maps.

### Custom Map Example (Northern Ireland Coastline)
Copy and paste this outline into the **Map Paths** field on the settings page to draw Belfast Lough, the border, and Lough Neagh:
